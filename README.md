# AWS EC2 Load Balancer Project

This is a simple AWS project that I created to understand how load balancing works with EC2 instances.
In this project, I launched two EC2 servers and installed Apache web server on both of them.  
Each server has its own index.html file so that the response from different servers can be identified.

## What I did in this project
- Created two EC2 instances
- Installed and configured Apache web server
- Deployed a basic website on both servers
- Tested the website on EC2 using terminal (localhost)
- Prepared the setup for future Elastic Load Balancer integration

## Server Information
- Server 1 Public IP: 98.90.197.47
- Server 2 Public IP: 107.21.184.42

## Current Status
The website is working on the EC2 servers when tested locally through the terminal.  
Public browser access and load balancer integration will be completed as the next step.

## Purpose
This project is part of my learning journey in AWS and cloud computing.  
It helped me understand EC2, basic networking, and how load balancing improves availability.
